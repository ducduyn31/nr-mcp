# For Users

This section is for users who want to use the nr-mcp server with their AI assistants.

## Prerequisites

- New Relic account with:
  - API key
  - Account ID
  - Region (US or EU)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the Docker container with required environment variables
docker run -it --rm \
  -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  -e NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id \
  -e NEW_RELIC_REGION=US \
  ducduyn31/nr-mcp
```

## MCP Client Configuration

To connect an AI assistant to nr-mcp, add the following configuration to your MCP client setup:

### Docker Connection

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "newrelic": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "NEW_RELIC_API_KEY",
        "-e",
        "NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "-e",
        "NEW_RELIC_REGION",
        "ducduyn31/nr-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEW_RELIC_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID": "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>",
        "NEW_RELIC_REGION": "US"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Installation Connection

```json

    "newrelic": {
      "command": "nr-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "NEW_RELIC_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID": "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>",
        "NEW_RELIC_REGION": "US"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using with AI Assistants

When using nr-mcp with AI assistants like Claude Opus or GPT-4o, include the following in your prompt:

```
I need to analyze New Relic data for my application.
Please use the nr-mcp server to:
1. Run NRQL queries
2. Fetch dashboard data
3. Analyze logs
4. [Your specific task]

Example NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago
```

# For Developers

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the nr-mcp project.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ducduyn31/nr-mcp.git
cd nr-mcp

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build
```

## Docker Development

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
# Build the Docker image locally
docker build -t nr-mcp .

# Build with a specific tag
docker build -t nr-mcp:1.6.0 .
```

### Running the Docker Container for Development

```bash
# Run with environment variables for development
docker run -it --rm \
  -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  -e NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id \
  -e NEW_RELIC_REGION=US \
  nr-mcp
```

The MCP Inspector is a powerful tool for debugging and testing MCP servers and clients.
We've added a streamlined development workflow that automatically watches for file changes, rebuilds the project, and runs the inspector:

```bash
# Start the development workflow
pnpm dev
```

This command:
1. Watches the `src` directory for changes to `.ts` files
2. Automatically rebuilds the project when changes are detected
3. Runs the MCP Inspector in parallel

### Manual Testing

You can also run these commands separately:

```bash
# Watch for file changes and rebuild
pnpm watch

# Start the inspector
pnpm inspector
```

### Using the Inspector

Once the inspector is running:

1. Open the web interface (typically at http://localhost:5173)
2. Select "Connect to Server"
3. Choose "Stdio" as the transport type
4. Enter the command to start your server: `node dist/index.js`
5. Click "Connect"

After connecting, you can:
- Browse available tools
- Make test calls with custom parameters
- View responses and any errors
- Record and replay testing sessions

### Debugging Tips

- Use the inspector to compare expected vs. actual responses
- Monitor the full request/response cycle for each tool call
- Check for proper error handling by intentionally sending invalid inputs
- Verify that your tools adhere to their declared schemas

## Development

```bash
# Create a new tool
pnpm create-tool

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format
```
