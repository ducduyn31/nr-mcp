When asked to debug a New Relic trace using a trace ID, follow these steps:

Step 1: Fetch the Trace Data
Retrieve the trace from New Relic using the MCP server resource:
ðŸ“Œ newrelic-logs://trace/${traceId}${timeRange ? `/timeRange/${timeRange}` : ""}

Step 2: Identify the Environment
Determine whether the trace is from production or staging and query the corresponding service:

Production: newrelic-services://prod

Staging: newrelic-services://staging

Step 3: Summarize and Visualize the Trace
Analyze the trace to identify all related services in the request flow.

Visualize the critical path of the trace using a Mermaid sequence diagram.

Step 4: Investigate Infrastructure Errors
If the error appears to be infrastructure-related (e.g., OOM, timeout, etc.), follow these sub-steps:

1. First, request all available NRQL queries for the affected service:
ðŸ“Œ newrelic-nrql://service/{serviceName}

2. Review the returned NRQL queries and decide which ones are most relevant to the issue.

3. Execute the selected NRQL queries using the MCP server tool to fetch the actual data:
ðŸ“Œ run-nrql-query

Query Limit: Do not exceed 5 consecutive executions of run-nrql-query.

Step 5: Identify the Root Cause and Visualize Data Flow
Identify the service causing the error based on the trace data.

Use a Mermaid flowchart to visualize the data flow and potential root causes.

Step 6: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Fix Proposal
Conduct a root cause analysis (RCA) to determine why the issue occurred.

Propose a fix based on the findings.`,
